# TaskVault - Grizzlython Hackathon Submission 2023
TaskVault is a decentralized freelancing platform for Solana and the Web3-Space. It aims to be the one-stop-shop for aspiring web3-freelancers to find a web3-job the web3-way. It is best understood in terms of its components:
- TaskVault is a matching service for finding and hiring Web3-Talent.
- TaskVault is a secure escrow service for handling stablecoin-payments related to Freelancing-Jobs.
- TaskVault is a smart arbitration system for handling disputes related to Freelancing-Jobs. 

TaskVault is being built, because the status quo of freelancing in web3 is clearly broken. Today, freelancers must establish a high-level of trust with the client first before even being able to work, because there is no easy way to handle escrow payments yet. And existing (web2) freelancing-platforms like upwork or fiverr, do not support stable-coins and charge really high fees (10-25%).
